        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
          <li className="mb-4">Eat a balanced diet: Focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods that provide a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your meals.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Stay hydrated: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to maintain proper hydration. Water supports digestion, regulates body temperature, and helps transport nutrients.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Prioritize regular exercise: Engage in physical activities that you enjoy, such as walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Get enough sleep: Establish a consistent sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. A good night's sleep promotes physical and mental recovery.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Manage stress: Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as practicing mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies and activities that bring you joy.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Maintain a healthy weight: Strive for a weight that is within a healthy range for your body. Focus on sustainable lifestyle changes rather than quick-fix diets.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Limit processed foods: Minimize your consumption of processed foods high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Opt for whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Practice portion control: Be mindful of your portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls, and listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues.</li>
          <li className="mb-4">Cultivate healthy relationships: Surround yourself with supportive and positive people who uplift and inspire you. Nurture meaningful connections with family, friends, and community.</li>
          <li>Take care of your mental health: Prioritize self-care activities, seek help when needed, and engage in practices that promote emotional well-being, such as meditation or journaling.</li>
        </ol>
