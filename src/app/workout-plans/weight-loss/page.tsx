        <p>Welcome to our Weight Loss Workout Plan, designed specifically for individuals who are seeking to lose weight and improve their overall fitness. This comprehensive plan combines cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and smart nutrition to help you reach your weight loss goals effectively and sustainably.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Overview</h2>
        <p>Our Weight Loss Workout Plan is tailored to maximize calorie burn, boost metabolism, and promote fat loss. With a combination of targeted exercises and a balanced approach to nutrition, you'll be on your way to achieving your desired weight and improving your overall health.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Workout Schedule</h2>
        <p>For optimal results, we recommend following this workout plan four to five days a week, allowing for rest and recovery. Each session should last approximately 45 to 60 minutes, providing a challenging yet manageable routine.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Day 1</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Warm-up:</strong> Begin with a 5-10 minute warm-up, such as jogging or cycling, to prepare your body for exercise.<br />
          <strong>Cardiovascular Exercise:</strong> Engage in 20-30 minutes of high-intensity cardio, such as running, cycling, or using a stair climber, to burn calories and improve cardiovascular fitness.<br />
          <strong>Strength Training:</strong> Incorporate exercises that target major muscle groups, such as squats, lunges, deadlifts, and bench presses. Perform three sets of 10-12 repetitions for each exercise, gradually increasing the weight as you progress.<br />
          <strong>Cool-down and Stretching:</strong> Conclude the workout with 5-10 minutes of stretching exercises to promote muscle recovery and flexibility.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Day 2</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Rest or Active Rest:</strong> Take a day of rest or engage in light activities like yoga, Pilates, or swimming to promote active recovery and flexibility.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Day 3</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Warm-up:</strong> Start with a 5-10 minute warm-up to prepare your body for the workout ahead.<br />
          <strong>Cardiovascular Exercise:</strong> Incorporate 30-40 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio, such as brisk walking, elliptical training, or rowing, to continue burning calories and improving endurance.<br />
          <strong>Strength Training:</strong> Focus on compound exercises that engage multiple muscle groups, such as squats, lunges, shoulder presses, and bent-over rows. Perform three sets of 10-12 repetitions with challenging weights.<br />
          <strong>Cool-down and Stretching:</strong> End the session with 5-10 minutes of stretching exercises to promote flexibility and prevent muscle tightness.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Day 4</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Rest or Active Rest:</strong> Take another day of rest or engage in low-impact activities like yoga, stretching, or light resistance training to promote active recovery and rejuvenation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Day 5</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Warm-up:</strong> Begin with a 5-10 minute warm-up to prepare your body for the workout ahead.<br />
          <strong>Cardiovascular Exercise:</strong> Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for 20-30 minutes. Alternate between periods of intense effort and active recovery to maximize calorie burn.<br />
          <strong>Strength Training:</strong> Include exercises that target specific muscle groups, such as dumbbell lunges, tricep dips, bicep curls, and planks. Perform three sets of 10-12 repetitions, focusing on maintaining proper form.<br />
          <strong>Cool-down and Stretching:</strong> Finish the workout with 5-10 minutes of stretching exercises to promote muscle recovery and flexibility.
